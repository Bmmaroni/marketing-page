            <h2>People</h2>
            <p>Good people make good places. Wherever you have been and whoever you have met carry a special place in your heart. Just the sight of someone's face can flood your mind with nostalgia. So many people so little time!</p>

            <h2>Stories</h2>
            <p>Stories are history. Sometimes history is about a country or a people group but each of us have our very own history behind us and before us. We write it down daily through our emotions and experiences. Stories are the internal and external account of our lives. What a shame it would be to keep it all to yourself.</p>
